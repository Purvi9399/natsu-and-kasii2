# Natsu & Kasii ✈️🌸

**A soft and soulful travel diary by Purvi & Ayushi**  
_“Because the world is too beautiful not to remember together.”_

## 💫 About the Project

**Natsu & Kasii** is not just a travel blog — it is a shared memory box. A digital diary. A canvas painted with cities, friendship, nostalgia, and the feeling of “natsukashii” — that beautiful Japanese word for the gentle ache of remembering something precious.

Built by **two best friends**, this project is a love letter to every place we’ve been together — from the cobbled charm of Prague to the poetic dusk of Paris. Every card, every image, and every word on this site is a frozen heartbeat of our journey.

## 🌸 Why “Natsu & Kasii”?

Inspired by the word **natsukashii (懐かしい)** — which evokes a tender longing for something dear in the past — we imagined two characters, *Natsu* and *Kasii*, as mirrors of ourselves. They wander together, collect cities like souvenirs, and pour stories into this evolving space.

We wanted a name that felt soft, lyrical, and symbolic — and one that *no one else had*.  
**Natsu & Kasii is us. And maybe, it’s you too.**

## 🎨 Vision & Design

We dreamt of a site that felt like:
- A scrapbook spilled across your screen 📖
- A polaroid wall you could touch 📸
- A whispered memory brought to life 💭

So we built it with:
- **Pastel colour palettes** (blush pinks, beige creams, lavender greys)
- **Rare custom fonts** (that feel handwritten and nostalgic)
- **Pinterest-style masonry grid** for city cards
- **GSAP animations** for soft scroll and fade-in moments
- **Responsive & interactive UI** that feels alive and gentle

## 📌 Our Dream

This is not just a side project.  
We want **Natsu & Kasii** to grow into a brand, a visual space, maybe even a book one day.

We want people to remember places not just with guides, but with feelings.  
And maybe, to travel a little more slowly. A little more soulfully.
